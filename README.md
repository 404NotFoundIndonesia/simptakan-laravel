# Simptakan

Simptakan (_Sistem Informasi Perpustakaan_) is a modern web-based platform designed to revolutionize library management and user experience. It aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for both library administrators and users, enhancing catalog exploration, book borrowing, and reading activity management.

## Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: Web-based application using modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript).
- **Compatibility**: Support for major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile platforms (iOS, Android).
- **Security**: Secure user authentication, data encryption, and privacy protection measures.
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle concurrent users and scale resources as needed.

## Technology Stack

- Laravel 11.0
- MySQL Community Server 8.3

## Get Started

### Prerequisite

- You need [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads) to run this, with a minimum installed version of **PHP 8.3.4**. Make sure you can also access PHP via the command line by adding it to the [path environment variable](https://rgrahardi.medium.com/pengaturan-path-php-dan-composer-di-environment-variables-windows-10-e1e22a637618).
- Make sure [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos) is also installed and accessible via the command line.
- Ensure that you have also installed [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
- I recommend installing [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for better code management.
